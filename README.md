# Java MemoryBitStream
Java MemoryBitStream offers output and input streams for writing and reading different types of data in bit-level.

for example it let you save value '7' of type int to memory only with 3 bits and not with ordinary 32 bits.

its very useful for those kind of applications which need to send and receive data on network very efficiently (for example: realtime multiplayer games).
